# Shell Sort

Shell Sort is mainly a variation of Insertion Sort. In Insertion Sort, we move elements only one position ahead.<br>
When an element has to be moved far ahead, many movements are involved. The idea of Shell Sort is to allow exchange of far items.<br>
In Shell Sort, we make the array h-sorted for a large value of h. We keep reducing the value of h until it becomes 1. An array is said to be h-sorted if all sublists of every hâ€™th element is sorted.<br>
