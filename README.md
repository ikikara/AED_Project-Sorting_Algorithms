## Description:
This was the 2nd project developed for Data Structures and Algorithms subject @University of Coimbra, Informatics Engineering <br>
Consists in develop a group of programs that make a study about time complexity (O(n)) of some sorting algorithms like Shell Sort, Quick Sort and Radix Sort.

#### Main Languages:
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-333333?style=flat&logo=java&logoColor=FFFFFF)

## Technologies used:
1. Java
    - [Version ??](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) 

## To run this project:
[WARNING] Java must be installed<br>
You have two ways to run this project:
1. Using Terminal:
    * Download on folder "src" the files *.java only
    * Compile the program (this will create a directory com/company, where files *.class will be created)
      ```shellscript
      [your-disk]:[name-path]> javac -d . *.java
      ```
    * Finally just run it
      ```shellscript
      [your-disk]:[name-path]> java com.company.Main
      ```

## Notes important to read:
   - In this repository folders 1, 2 and 3 are respective to different type of sorting algorithms. The way to run them it's the same
   - This programs will only print the time it took to run for a certain "n" that will be requested as input
   - Inside the code you can make changes to test the algorithm for different cases
   - Folder tests have some tests used when writing code 
   - For more information about this exercises consult the Statement (if you want to use them uncomment where says [TO RUN MANUALLY])
